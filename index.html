      <h2>Job Market Paper</h2>
      <p>This paper investigates how changes in firms’ ESG ratings influence institutional ownership and firm valuation. Using rating upgrades and downgrades, threshold-crossing events tied to index inclusion, and ETF additions and removals, I document that upgrades attract institutional investors and are associated with modest positive abnormal returns, while downgrades—particularly those triggering index exclusions—lead to significant ownership outflows and negative returns. The study employs propensity-score matching and dynamic difference-in-differences designs to establish causal effects, contributing to the literature on ESG, governance, and asset pricing.</p>

      <h2>Work in Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ESG Ratings & Ownership Structure and Value: Cross‑Country Evidence</strong> — International extension across regulatory settings.
          <p>This project expands my job market paper to a cross-country setting. Differences in regulatory environments, enforcement, and market sentiment across countries provide a unique context to examine how the effects of ESG ratings vary internationally. I built an automated Python pipeline to collect and process global ESG-focused ownership data from Morningstar Direct and integrated it with CRSP Global and MSCI ESG ratings. Preliminary analysis of ESG-focused mutual fund holdings is complete, and current work examines market reactions to rating changes, with ongoing efforts to refine results and add robustness tests.</p>
