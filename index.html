      <h2>Research Statement</h2>
      <p><strong>My research interest is in corporate finance, with a focus on corporate governance, agency conflicts, ownership structure, and how ESG integrates with these broader concepts.</strong> These themes guide all of my work, and you can see them in both my completed and ongoing papers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Job Market Paper:</strong> Examines the causal effect of ESG ratings on institutional ownership and firm value, using rigorous empirical approaches such as propensity score matching and difference-in-differences to identify the impact of ESG changes on investor behavior and market valuation.</li>
        <li><strong>Work in Process:</strong> Extends these questions to a global setting, comparing how institutional environments across countries influence the link between ownership, ESG, and firm value. This involves large-scale data collection and automation using Python and Morningstar Direct. Another project, <em>Governance by Contract: Shareholder Agreements and Corporate Control</em>, uses SEC contract data and large language models to study how shareholder agreements and legal shocks shape governance outcomes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Future Directions</h3>
      <p>Going forward, my research philosophy is to combine rigorous empirical methods with modern technology to explore important questions in corporate finance. I am guided by curiosity and a commitment to hard work, and I hope to continue producing research that is both empirically sound and contributes to a deeper understanding of corporate behavior.</p>

      <h2>ESG Ratings, Ownership Structure, and Firm Value</h2>
      <p class="small">This paper investigates how changes in firmsâ€™ ESG ratings influence institutional ownership and firm valuation. Using rating upgrades and downgrades, thresholdâ€‘crossing events tied to index inclusion, and ETF additions and removals, I document that upgrades attract institutional investors and are associated with modest positive abnormal returns, while downgradesâ€”particularly those triggering index exclusionsâ€”lead to significant ownership outflows and negative returns. The study employs propensityâ€‘score matching and dynamic differenceâ€‘inâ€‘differences designs to establish causal effects, contributing to the literature on ESG, governance, and asset pricing.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>ESG Ratings & Ownership Structure and Value: Crossâ€‘Country Evidence</strong> â€” International extension across regulatory settings.
          <p class="small">This project expands my job market paper to a crossâ€‘country setting. Differences in regulatory environments, enforcement, and market sentiment across countries provide a unique context to examine how the effects of ESG ratings vary internationally. I built an automated Python pipeline to collect and process global ESGâ€‘focused ownership data from Morningstar Direct and integrated it with CRSP Global and MSCI ESG ratings. Preliminary analysis of ESGâ€‘focused mutual fund holdings is complete, and current work examines market reactions to rating changes, with ongoing efforts to refine results and add robustness tests.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Governance by Contract: Shareholder Agreements & Corporate Control</strong> â€” SEC contract retrieval with LLM clause extraction; outcomes around legal shocks.</li>
          <p class="small">This project examines how markets perceive shareholder agreements as governance mechanisms. I exploit two opposing exogenous shocksâ€”a Delaware court ruling (Moelis) that invalidated such agreements if not included in the charter, and a subsequent legislative proposal to overturn the rulingâ€”to study market reactions. I have built a data pipeline using the SEC API to collect shareholder agreements, and preliminary event-study analysis is complete. Ongoing work focuses on leveraging a large language model (LLM) to automatically classify the powers granted to shareholdersâ€”a approach that allows for scalable and accurate analysisâ€”and refining how market reactions vary based on these contractual rights.</p>

      <h3>Teaching Philosophy & Growth</h3>
      <p>My teaching philosophy centers on fostering growth mindsets, critical thinking, and real-world application. I strive to create an inclusive, engaging classroom where students are encouraged to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and connect finance concepts to their own experiences. Assessment blends conceptual mastery with practical skills, including case analyses, data exercises, and peer discussion. I am committed to continuous improvement, regularly seeking feedback and reflecting on my teaching to better support student learning and development.</p>

        <li>"Enthusiastic teacher."</li>
        <li>"Definitely, so far, I've learned so many things that I can actually use in my life. Some topics were a little bit hard to comprehend, but for the most part I found them stretching my thinking."</li>
